# UB-BachelorThesis
The main goal of this thesis is to present ARCH and GARCH models, key concepts in
Time Series Analysis. These models are extremely useful when describing the behavior
of Financial time series (i.e. Stock returns, Exchange rates, Economic indexs...), because
they deal with volatility (variation of price in a delimited time period). The discipline
of Time Series Analysis as a whole is introduced, as well as its main concepts, which
are needed to further explore the useful properties behind ARCH and GARCH. We put
special emphasis in developing a consistent theory of Estimation and Forecasting (i.e
determinate the parameters of a model and predict future values) for Time Series Analysis,
which serves as a justification for estimating and predicting ARCH and GARCH models.
Practical examples are given using the R statistics package.
